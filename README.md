# detectron2_basic_training
This program can be used if you dont wish to write your own training program to train with detectron2. 
I will continue to update the readme with further documentation when I am more awake.
when this is finished my hope is it will help foster more interest in computer vision and object detection.
# Workflow
the besy way to currently do this is to build a container and open it in visual studio code and drop your datasets into a directory in the container and add the path to the train program.
